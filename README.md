1.API data pull 

Pulling national carbon intensity data for the most recent half hour period in the day. Automating the data pull so that it pulls every half an hour (10 times) and then appends the new data into the data list. 

Next steps will be to format and clean the data so that I can analyse and create visualisations using matplotlib. 

2. Web scraping from Amazon

Scraping title and price of a T-Shirt from Amazon using Beautiful Soup, cleaning data obtained from website adding timestamp and inputting into a CSV file - then creating automated data pull and appending to CSV. 

Based on Alex The Analyst's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiOtQMcI5wg - but using a different web page on Amazon 

3. BMI Calculator

BMI calculator created in Jupyter Notebooks following Alex The Analyst Tutorial on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey1VNjU0YbM) using else/if loop to classify BMI based on weight and height input.
