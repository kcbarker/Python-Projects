1. Web scraping from Amazon

Scraping title and price of a T-Shirt from Amazon using Beautiful Soup, cleaning data obtained from website adding timestamp and inputting into a CSV file - then creating automated data pull and appending to CSV. 

Based on Alex The Analyst's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiOtQMcI5wg - but using a different web page on Amazon 

2. API data pull

Pulling information from Alpha Vantage API about IBM stock. Creating automated data pull from API - the code shows the data being pulled every 60 seconds. For this particular data, I would really want to run the API pull daily, but the these purposes have demonstrated it every 60 seconds to show how it works. 

Next steps would be to pull daily and analyse the daily data over time to assess trends in the stock. 

3. BMI Calculator

BMI calculator created in Jupyter Notebooks following Alex The Analyst Tutorial on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey1VNjU0YbM) using else/if loop to classify BMI based on weight and height input.
